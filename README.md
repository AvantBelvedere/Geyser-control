 A Web server that displays ON and OFF buttons in html page with Temperature to activate a Geyser,
 which is controlled by a DS18B20 temperature sensor. When target temperature is reached,
 the relay will disconect power. The LCD submits the current status of the relay and by which means
 the relay was activated or deactivated. Works with Arduino Uno and W5100 Arduino Wiznet Ethernet shield.
